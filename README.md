# d3-react-map

This repo is an attempt to expand upon a [previous project](https://parkerziegler.github.io/d3-policeshootings-map/) of mine exploring police involved shootings in the United States. I've found that a lot of reporting on police involved shootings ignores spatial patterns. This suite of data visualizations is meant as an alternative.

This repo is also a place where I've been experimenting as I learn more about React, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Sass.
